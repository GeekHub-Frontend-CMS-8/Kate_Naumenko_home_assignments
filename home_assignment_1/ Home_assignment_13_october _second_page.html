        It All Started From Frustration <br>
        And Lack of a Better Solution
      </h1>
      <p>
        Last year we travelled to Philadelphia for the weekend and stayed at an Airbnb, as most millenials do. At check-out time (noon), we tried to leave our bags in the apartment while exploring the city and pick up before our train leaves, but there was nowhere to leave them. It’d be a nightmare to schlep these luggage around ALL DAY. Having no other choice, we left our bags unattended in the hallway, and still had to carry our heavy backpacks. Yikes. Then it clicked, we’re not the only ones going through this trouble. You probably did too, and millions of others.
